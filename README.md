A collection of cursed types or a repository in which I abuse the fact that TypeScript's type system is Turing complete to write programs that "run" at compile time.

`type-challenges/` - My solutions to problems from https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges.

`random/` - Basically everything else, e.g. a Conway's Game of Life simulator.
